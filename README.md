# 🗺️ Treasure Game

A simple text-based game written in Python where the player makes choices to find a hidden treasure. This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to practice logic, conditionals, and user interaction in the terminal.

## 🚀 What I learned

- Basic Python syntax
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Functions and input handling
- Project structure and using Git/GitHub

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3
- Terminal/Command Line

## 🕹️ Game Flowchart (Spoiler!)
